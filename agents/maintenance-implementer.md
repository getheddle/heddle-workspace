# maintenance-implementer

**Status:** validated (field-tested 2026-05-19 on the mandated safe
session — comments/TODOs only, throwaway branch
`audit-fieldtest/maint-implementer-session-c`: mechanically-verified
clean diff of 8 comment insertions, **zero** non-comment line changes,
tests green, no commit/push/PR, and it correctly declined to mark the
MUST findings it was documenting. Human-reviewed and the field-test
branch retired). The responsibilities below are its contract.

## Responsibility

Execute exactly one lettered session brief from a maintenance cycle.

## Inputs

- Path to a single session-starter file under a cycle subfolder
  (`session-starters/<repo>-<topic>-<date>/<letter>-<theme>.md`).
- Implicit context: the cycle's `0-roadmap-overview.md` and the
  source audit it links to.

## Outputs

- Commits on a feature branch in the target sibling repo (one branch
  per cycle is the default; one per letter is also acceptable for
  large surgeries — the brief says which).
- Paired `<letter>-<theme>-feedback.md` next to the brief: the C-M
  contract skeleton (`hooman-assistant` `contracts.md`) plus optional
  Executor notes, per *Feedback files* in the workspace's
  `session-starters/README.md`.
- On blocker: do not force a fix. Stop, write the blocker into the
  feedback file under a `## Blocked` section, and return.

## Constraints (per `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)

- Minimum code. Smallest change that satisfies the brief.
- Surgical. No reformat-while-you're-in-there.
- Strong success criteria: every brief lands a verifiable end state
  (test, lint, build, observed behavior). Don't claim done without it.

## Out of scope

- Auditing (that's `audit-runner`).
- Planning the next session (that's `maintenance-planner`).
- Touching letters this brief didn't claim.
