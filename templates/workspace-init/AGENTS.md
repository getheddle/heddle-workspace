# AGENTS.md — {{name}} (Heddle workspace)

This directory is a **Heddle workspace** — a parent directory holding
the [getheddle/*](https://github.com/getheddle) family repositories
and one or more consuming applications as flat siblings.

## Governance

Governed by the [Hooman Method](https://github.com/hooman/hooman-method)
(operating rules: the `hooman-assistant` skill). Pinned projection:
`references/UPSTREAM`.

## Shared agent guidance

Cross-repo invariants, philosophy, schema source-of-truth direction,
and reusable skills/subagents live in
[`heddle-workspace/`](heddle-workspace/). The canonical skills live in
`heddle-workspace/skills/`; subagents live in
`heddle-workspace/agents/`. Agent-specific discovery paths (`.claude/`,
`.agents/`, `.cursor/`, `.windsurf/`, `.cline/`, `GEMINI.md`,
`QWEN.md`, and others) are adapters back to those canonical files.
See `heddle-workspace/docs/AGENT_ADAPTERS.md` for the full adapter map.

If you are an AI agent, your first step is to invoke
`/heddle-orient`.

Install or refresh local agent adapters with:

```bash
./heddle-workspace/bin/install-agent-adapters --workspace .
```

## Two kinds of work, two workflows

This workspace tracks two distinct kinds of work, each with its own
folder, discipline, and rhythm. **Before starting work, identify
which kind you are doing** and follow the rules for that kind.

| Kind | Examples | Folder | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Feature work** | New module, contrib, feature, cross-repo coordination, design exploration | [`roadmap/`](roadmap/) | [`roadmap/README.md`](roadmap/README.md) |
| **Maintenance work** | Repository review fixes, security audit, dep/lang upgrades, perf optimization, doc drift pass, schema audit | [`session-starters/<cycle>/`](session-starters/) | [`session-starters/README.md`](session-starters/README.md) |

**Feature work** is Chat-designed then Code-implemented. The
persistent home is a `roadmap/<track>.md` file. The bridge from
roadmap thinking to an executable session is a loose prompt file in
`session-starters/`.

**Maintenance work** is review-driven and Code-executed. The
persistent home is a **cycle subfolder** inside `session-starters/`,
with a `0-roadmap-overview.md` index plus thematic sibling sessions
lettered A through K. The source of items is always a review
artifact (audit report) under [`audits/`](audits/) — never invented
from imagination.

The audit ↔ cycle link is **mechanical, by name** (see
[`audits/README.md`](audits/README.md)):

```
audit:  audits/<repo>-audits/<topic>-audit-<YYYY-MM-DD>(.md|/)
cycle:  session-starters/<repo>-<topic>-<YYYY-MM-DD>/
```

Per-repo audit subfolders are created lazily by `workspace init` /
`workspace add` and preserved when a repo is removed. The audit-type
catalog and audit document shape live in
[`heddle-workspace/docs/AUDITS.md`](heddle-workspace/docs/AUDITS.md).

If you are not sure which kind your task is:

- "Build X" → feature work → `roadmap/`.
- "Fix the findings in audit Y" → maintenance work →
  `session-starters/<repo>-<topic>-<date>/`.
- "Audit Z" → run the `audit-runner` subagent; the report lands in
  `audits/<repo>-audits/` and seeds a new maintenance cycle.
- "Upgrade lib W to vN" → maintenance work, seeded by a `deps` audit.

## Workspace-level vs. repo-level

| Workspace root (here) | Each sibling repo |
|---|---|
| Agent adapters pointing to toolkit skills + subagents | Repo-local agent commands and instructions |
| Cross-cutting design docs and specs that span repos | Repo-internal docs |
| This `AGENTS.md` | Each repo's own `AGENTS.md` |
| `roadmap/` + `session-starters/` + `audits/` | Repo-internal CHANGELOG + issues |

For repo-specific verification commands and module layout, read the
relevant sibling's own `AGENTS.md`. Bootstrap a sibling's repo-level
`AGENTS.md` from `heddle-workspace/templates/repo-init/AGENTS.md` — it
*extends* this root file rather than restating it.

## VSCode

Open `{{name}}.code-workspace` for a multi-root view of the
siblings.

## Convention reference

`heddle-workspace/anchors/WORKSPACE.md` — the technical
reference for workspace detection, cross-repo git conventions, and
path conventions.

## Further tuning of the Claude Code environment

Two optional, recommended add-ons for this workspace:

### `claude-code-setup` plugin

The `claude-code-setup` plugin (from the
`claude-plugins-official` marketplace) provides a meta-skill —
`/claude-code-setup:claude-automation-recommender` — that analyzes
this workspace and suggests Claude Code automations (hooks,
subagents, skills, MCP servers) tailored to what's checked out. Run
it after adding a new sibling repo, or when you want a second
opinion on workflow gaps.

Install once per Claude Code user:

```
/plugin marketplace add claude-plugins-official
/plugin install claude-code-setup@claude-plugins-official
```

Then invoke from any session at this workspace root:

```
/claude-code-setup:claude-automation-recommender
```

It only reads the workspace; it does not modify files. Ask Claude
to implement specific recommendations.

### MCP servers

Two MCP servers materially improve Heddle-family work:

| Server | Why |
|---|---|
| `context7` | Live docs for Pydantic, nats-py, structlog, DuckDB, LanceDB, etc. — avoids stale-recall errors. No auth. |
| `github` | Cross-repo PR/issue/CI access for `getheddle/*` repos; pairs well with `/cross-repo-pr`. Reads token from `gh auth token` at MCP startup. |

The toolkit ships a project-scoped `.mcp.json` template with both
servers pre-configured. Drop it in at the workspace root with:

```
./heddle-workspace/install.sh --workspace --mcp .
```

(Or run `--mcp` alone if the workspace is already installed.) See
`heddle-workspace/mcp/README.md` for prerequisites (`npx`,
authenticated `gh`) and manual-merge guidance when a `.mcp.json`
already exists. See `hooks/README.md` for the hooks template that
complements the MCP servers.
