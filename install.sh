#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install.sh — link toolkit skills and agents into a target's .claude/
#
# This is the legacy Claude Code bootstrap. To install all supported
# discovery adapters for Claude, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, and
# other coding agents, prefer:
#   ./bin/install-agent-adapters --workspace <workspace-path>
#
# Usage:
#   ./install.sh <target-repo-path>            # single-repo install
#   ./install.sh --workspace <workspace-path>  # workspace install
#   ./install.sh --hooks <target>              # also drop hooks template
#
# Single-repo mode (default): creates symlinks inside
# <target>/.claude/skills/ and <target>/.claude/agents/ pointing back
# into this toolkit. The target's existing .claude/settings.json and
# .claude/commands/ are left untouched.
#
# Workspace mode (--workspace): same symlink install, plus drops a
# starter workspace-level AGENTS.md and a starter <workspace-name>.code-
# workspace file if neither exists yet. Use this when the target is a
# parent directory holding the Heddle family repos and consuming apps
# as flat siblings. See anchors/WORKSPACE.md for the convention.
#
# Hooks (--hooks): copies hooks/settings.template.json to
# <target>/.claude/settings.json ONLY if no settings.json exists. We
# never merge JSON automatically — if a settings file already exists,
# see hooks/README.md for the manual merge steps. Can be combined with
# --workspace.
#
# MCP (--mcp): copies mcp/.mcp.template.json to <target>/.mcp.json ONLY
# if no .mcp.json exists. See mcp/README.md for the manual merge steps
# when a file already exists, and for prerequisites (npx, gh CLI).
# Typically combined with --workspace since .mcp.json is most useful
# at the workspace root.
#
# Idempotent: re-running replaces existing toolkit-owned symlinks but
# does not touch entries that are not toolkit symlinks. Workspace
# extras (AGENTS.md, .code-workspace, settings.json, .mcp.json) are
# only created when absent; an existing file is never overwritten.

This directory is a **Heddle workspace** — a parent directory holding
the [getheddle/*](https://github.com/getheddle) family repositories
and one or more consuming applications as flat siblings.

## Shared agent guidance

Cross-repo invariants, philosophy, schema source-of-truth direction,
and reusable skills/subagents live in
[\`heddle-workspace/\`](heddle-workspace/). The canonical skills live in
\`heddle-workspace/skills/\`; subagents live in
\`heddle-workspace/agents/\`. Agent-specific discovery paths such as
\`.claude/\` and \`~/.codex/skills/heddle/\` are symlink adapters back to
those canonical files.

If you are an AI agent, your first step is to invoke
\`/heddle-orient\`.

Install or refresh local agent adapters with:

\`\`\`
./heddle-workspace/bin/install-agent-adapters --workspace .
\`\`\`

## Workspace-level vs. repo-level

| Workspace root (here) | Each sibling repo |
|---|---|
| Agent adapters pointing to toolkit skills + subagents | Repo-local agent commands and instructions |
| Cross-cutting design docs and specs that span repos | Repo-internal docs |
| This \`AGENTS.md\` | Each repo's own \`AGENTS.md\` |

For repo-specific verification commands and module layout, read the
relevant sibling's own \`AGENTS.md\`.

## VSCode

Open \`${ws_name}.code-workspace\` for a multi-root view of the
siblings.

## Convention reference

\`heddle-workspace/anchors/WORKSPACE.md\` — the technical
reference for workspace detection, cross-repo git conventions, and
path conventions.

## Further tuning of the Claude Code environment

Two optional, recommended add-ons for this workspace:

### \`claude-code-setup\` plugin

The \`claude-code-setup\` plugin (from the
\`claude-plugins-official\` marketplace) provides a meta-skill —
\`/claude-code-setup:claude-automation-recommender\` — that analyzes
this workspace and suggests Claude Code automations (hooks,
subagents, skills, MCP servers) tailored to what's checked out. Run
it after adding a new sibling repo, or when you want a second
opinion on workflow gaps.

Install once per Claude Code user:

\`\`\`
/plugin marketplace add claude-plugins-official
/plugin install claude-code-setup@claude-plugins-official
\`\`\`

Then invoke from any session at this workspace root:

\`\`\`
/claude-code-setup:claude-automation-recommender
\`\`\`

It only reads the workspace; it does not modify files. Ask Claude
to implement specific recommendations.

### MCP servers

Two MCP servers materially improve Heddle-family work:

| Server | Why |
|---|---|
| \`context7\` | Live docs for Pydantic, nats-py, structlog, DuckDB, LanceDB, etc. — avoids stale-recall errors. No auth. |
| \`github\` | Cross-repo PR/issue/CI access for \`getheddle/*\` repos; pairs well with \`/cross-repo-pr\`. Reads token from \`gh auth token\` at MCP startup. |

The toolkit ships a project-scoped \`.mcp.json\` template with both
servers pre-configured. Drop it in at the workspace root with:

\`\`\`
./heddle-workspace/install.sh --workspace --mcp .
\`\`\`

(Or run \`--mcp\` alone if the workspace is already installed.) See
\`heddle-workspace/mcp/README.md\` for prerequisites (\`npx\`,
authenticated \`gh\`) and manual-merge guidance when a \`.mcp.json\`
already exists. See \`hooks/README.md\` for the hooks template that
complements the MCP servers.
